I like going to restaurants at the weeken
d very much. It’s a splendid opportunity to rest from day-to-day cares and just relax. Before setting off for a restaurant, I necessarily reserve (book
) a table for me not to wait to be seated. If I go there on my own, I make a reservation for one person. If my friends come 
along with me, then I book a table for two or more people.
In my city there different kinds of restaurants – Indian, French, Chinese and so on. I prefer oriental cuisine, so I can often be found in Japanese restaurants. 
Probably everyone is aware of the most signature dish of the Japanese – there’s no doubt that it is sushi.
